======== Release 0.1
* 0.1-2: Slight revision of the documentation of density estimation methods.
* 0.1-1: Help pages refined. Correction of the print procedures for startup message.
* 0.1-0: The package is optimized for the ex-Gaussian distribution only. The histogram density
  estimator is refined, and both the distance density estimator and the gaussian kernel estimator
  are implemented. The gaussian kernel is used to find the peak of each parameter distribution
  using the bootstrap. Implementation of the procedure for the rejection of bootstrapped sigma
  values outside the theoretical interval. Upgrade of the licence: from the GPLv2 to the GPLv3.

======== Release 0.0
* From 0.0-2 to 0.0-5: The package is renamed 'retimes'. The bootstrap is reactivated and different
  implementations of the function 'timefit' are tested.
* 0.0-1: Reorganization of the package: the bootstrap is frozen, the function 'fdp' is renamed
  'timefit', and it is implemented only for the ex-Gaussian and Gamma distributions. Implementation
  in C code of the function 'starting_values' to find start parameters by the shape of distribution.
* 0.0-0: First experimental implementation of the package, including the Beta, Beta-prime, Gamma
  and Weibull distributions.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Mu_full_BF = lmBF(Mu ~ Mem_Update + OSPAN + RAPM + Task, data = Task_Zscore_Final, whichRandom = 'subject')
Mu_null_BF = lmBF(Mu ~ Mem_Update + OSPAN + RAPM, data = Task_Zscore_Final, whichRandom = 'subject')
#Full model on top = testing whether there's evidence in favor of the Full model. Bigger than 1 means evidence for # on top, less than 1 means evidence for # on bottom (in our case null)
Mu_full_BF/Mu_null_BF

# BFjzs = 4.95). The Bayes Factor suggests moderate evidence for the full model (OR for the effect of Task on Mu). 
```
```{r}
#BF for RAPM in Mu
Mu_full_BF = lmBF(Mu ~ Mem_Update + OSPAN + RAPM + Task, data = Task_Zscore_Final, whichRandom = 'subject')
Mu_null_BF = lmBF(Mu ~ Mem_Update + OSPAN + Task, data = Task_Zscore_Final, whichRandom = 'subject')

Mu_full_BF/Mu_null_BF

# BFjzs = 0.366)^1. The Bayes Factor suggests anecdotal evidence for the null model.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
